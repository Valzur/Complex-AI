This is essentially a more in depth AI Solution.
It separates the AI brain into modules that can be reordered using a graph view. It also provides the AI with a data Repo where each module processes the data in some way before an Action Module (or more than one) decides to act on it.

The project was abandoned hence in my use personal use, it seemed the complexity did more bad than good, enemies did not need to be too complicated, and if they were, the project would run into performance issues due to the way it
<i>"encourages developing stuff through code"</i> which would have performance be a thing you constantly need to worry about for any project that actually requires this depth. I do think however that this concept could work as a Data Oriented approach, and could be much more performant if ECS was supported.
